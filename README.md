# LeafyLens

LeafyLens is a web-based portal designed to assist farmers in two crucial stages of crop growth: the **Sowing Stage** and the **Growth Stage**. It integrates machine learning models to provide crop recommendations and disease detection, ensuring better agricultural outcomes.

## Features

### ðŸŒ± Sowing Stage
- **Crop Recommendation System**
- Uses **Random Forest Regression**
- Considers soil parameters: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels
- Incorporates weather conditions: Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity
- Recommends the most suitable crop based on the provided data

### ðŸŒ¾ Growth Stage
- **Crop Disease Detection Model**
- Built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- Supports **pre-trained models like ResNet50 and VGG16**
- Works with datasets of various crop diseases
- Users can upload multiple-angle images of a crop for analysis
- Identifies diseases and suggests potential solutions

## Models Used
- **Maize:** CNN, VGG16
- **Cashew:** CNN, MLP

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy
- **Dataset Processing:** Image preprocessing and augmentation techniques

   ```
   
## Usage
1. Select **Sowing Stage** or **Growth Stage**.
2. For **Sowing Stage**, enter soil and weather details to get a crop recommendation.
3. For **Growth Stage**, select the crop type, upload images, and get disease predictions with solutions.
